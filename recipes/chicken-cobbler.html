    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This comforting chicken cobbler combines everything you love about classic comfort food into one easy dish, featuring a rich, creamy shredded chicken filling topped with a golden, buttery biscuit crust.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong>: 1/2 cup</li>
        <li><strong>Frozen mixed vegatables</strong>: 15 oz</li>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong>: 2 cups</li>
        <li><strong>Cream of chicken soup</strong>: 10.5 oz</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken stock</strong>: 2 cup</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh chopped parsley</strong>: 2 tbsp</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients and preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the butter in the bottom of a 9&times;13-inch baking dish and set it in the oven until the butter melts.</li>
        <li>Once the butter has melted, arrange the chicken in a single layer over it, then evenly scatter the frozen vegetables on top.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the biscuit mix, the included seasoning packet, and the milk until smooth. Pour the mixture over the chicken and vegetables, spreading it gently and evenly across the top without stirring.</li>
        <li>Whisk together soup and stock in a second bowl until smooth. Pour over biscuit mix but do not stir.</li>
        <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until the top is deeply golden and the center is just slightly jiggly, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>If desired, sprinkle parsley over the top and let it rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
