    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These garlic noodles may seem simple at first, but they&rsquo;re incredibly flavorful. The dish originated in the 1970s at a San Francisco restaurant called Thanh Long. Traditionally paired with roasted Dungeness crab, the original recipe remains a tightly kept family secret. However, after extensive research and plenty of trial and error, this version comes very close to the original.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <!-- This is just for the secret sauce, there's a extra ingredients for the noodles -->
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Soy sauce</strong>: 2 tbsp</li>
        <li><strong>Oyster sauce</strong>: 1 tbsp</li>
        <li><strong>Worcestershire</strong>: 2 tsp</li>
        <li><strong>Fish sauce</strong>: 2 tsp</li>
        <li><strong>Sesame oil</strong>: 1/4 tsp</li>
        <li><strong>Cayenne pepper</strong>: 1 pinch</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Assemble all the ingredients. In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, Worcestershire sauce, fish sauce, sesame oil, and cayenne pepper to make the signature sauce.</li>
        <li>Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, just until fragrant—about 1 minute. Quickly stir in the prepared sauce, then remove the skillet from the heat.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Add the spaghetti and cook, stirring occasionally, until it&&rsquo;s tender but still slightly firm, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Use tongs to transfer the spaghetti directly into the sauce, bringing along a bit of the cooking water. Toss until the noodles are well coated, then mix in the Parmesan cheese. Add a splash more pasta water if the noodles seem too dry.</li>
        <li>Serve the noodles on plates and finish with a sprinkle of chopped green onions and red pepper flakes.</li>
    </ol>
