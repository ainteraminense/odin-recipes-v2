# odin-recipes-v2
This is the first project of the Odin project. In the beginning I used only html to build the page, and the goal was to train newly html skills. More specifically heading, paragraphs, links, images and lists.

It's called v2 because I had a previous project with the same name. 

## CSS
When I learned more css properties I used to style the pages of the website. I mainly worked with colors, texts and positioning.
